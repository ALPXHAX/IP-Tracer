### **_IP-TRACER_**
This is a lightweight and user friendly IP-Tracer script built in Python.
I am a fairly new developer so make sure to correct me where I am wrong.

**### How to download and execute IP-TRACER?**

`git clone https://github.com/ALPXHAX/IP-Tracer`

`cd IP-Tracer`

`python IP-Tracer.py`


**The usage of IP-Tracer is very user friendly and therefore doesn't need any tutorial.**
